hot-folder-image-compressor
===========================

Node.js CLI tool that listens to a folder (hot folder) and it's subfolders and optimizes all images added to it.

It was inspired by [grunt-contrib-imagemin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin) and uses (as by Feb '14) the same optimizer under the hood. The difference is that hot-folder-image-compressor is not relying on grunt and is aming to be used for e.g. a studio team to automatically optimize their creative output.
